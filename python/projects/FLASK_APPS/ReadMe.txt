Bash Script Documentation
Script Overview
This Bash script automates the interaction with a SQLite database and a Flask application, logging actions and handling errors gracefully. The script retrieves a student's ID and joining date, activates a virtual environment, executes Flask commands, and logs the process.

function handle_error {
    log_message "ERROR: Failed - $1"
    echo "ERROR: $1"
    exit 1
}
Logs and prints error messages and exits the script with an error status.
Execute Command Function
bash
Copy code
# Function to execute commands with logging
function execute_command {
    # Print and log the command being executed
    echo "Executing:"

Conclusion
This script is designed to streamline the process of interacting with a SQLite database and a Flask application while maintaining comprehensive logs and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding how variables and special syntax work in Bash scripting is crucial for writing effective scripts. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the elements you mentioned:

1. $1, $*, $@
$1, $2, ...: These are positional parameters. $1 refers to the first argument passed to the script or function, $2 refers to the second, and so on. For example:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
$*: This represents all the positional parameters as a single word. If you use it in a script with multiple arguments, they will be concatenated into one string:

bash
Copy code
echo "All arguments as a single string: $*"
$@: Similar to $*, but it treats each argument as a separate word. This is useful when you want to preserve the individual arguments, especially when they contain spaces:

bash
Copy code
for arg in "$@"; do
    echo "Argument: $arg"
done
2. $(...)
Command Substitution: This syntax allows you to capture the output of a command and use it as a variable. For example:
bash
Copy code
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')
echo "Today's date: $CURRENT_DATE"
In this case, the command date +'%Y-%m-%d' is executed, and its output is assigned to the variable CURRENT_DATE.
3. read var1 var2
Read Command: This command reads input from the user or standard input and assigns it to variables. For example:
bash
Copy code
read var1 var2
echo "Variable 1: $var1"
echo "Variable 2: $var2"
If you enter Hello World, var1 will be Hello and var2 will be World.
4. Here Documents (<<)
Here Document (Heredoc): This is a way to provide multi-line input to commands. The syntax is << followed by a delimiter. The text will be read until the delimiter is encountered. For example:
bash
Copy code
cat <<EOF
This is a
multi-line
string.
EOF
This will output:
csharp
Copy code
This is a
multi-line
string.
